							<h4>FAMILY HISTORY</h4>
							<p>The child had been a victim of neglect, and the family had been under the supervision of the state Division of Family and Children’s Services.</p>
							<p>Child-welfare officials had removed the girl’s two older siblings from the family home because of neglect. According to court records, the mother had been convicted in a methamphetamine case in Alabama.</p>
							<br>
							<h4>DETAILS OF DEATH</h4>
							<p>The girl’s mother found her body in bed at their home outside Tallapoosa. An autopsy found that she was malnourished and had died from an intentional overdose of Fentanyl, an opiate painkiller mostly used to treat cancer patients. The mother, Melanie Pritchard, and the father, Robert Derek Downey, both have been charged with murder. In court records, each has blamed the other for the death.</p>
							<br>
							<h4>PANEL REVIEW</h4>
							<p>The Haralson County child fatality review committee took up the case June 13, 2013 – eight months after the girl’s death. The committee’s report does not indicate that members raised questions about DFCS’ performance in the case.</p>
							<p>The committee made no recommendations. Its only finding was that the review took place too long after the death and that “inadequate investigation precluded having enough information for review.”</p>
