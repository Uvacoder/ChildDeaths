							<p><strong>County:</strong> Butts<br>
							<strong>Child’s age:</strong> 1<br>
							<strong>Date of death:</strong> May 14, 2012<br>
							<strong>Cause of death:</strong> Cardiac arrest while sleeping with his father.</p>
							<p><strong>Details:</strong> A month earlier, the Division of Family and Children Services had received a report that the boy had been physically abused. But it said the person allegedly responsible “was unable to be interviewed.” On the day the child died, according to a DFCS report, “little documentation” existed in his case file; by the next day, a caseworker had entered reports and photographs – obviously after the fact. An autopsy raised questions about possible abuse, noting the child had swelling in his brain and several contusions. But the medical examiner couldn’t definitively say whether the child died because of physical trauma or because of a medical condition.</p>
							<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Not reviewed.</p>

							<p><strong>County:</strong> DeKalb<br>
							<strong>Child’s age:</strong> 3<br>
							<strong>Date of death:</strong> Aug. 21, 2012<br>
							<strong>Cause of death:</strong> Blunt force trauma of the head.</p>
							<p><strong>Details:</strong> The girl’s grandmother told police she was in bed reading the Bible when she noticed that the child’s eyes had rolled back in her head and white foam was coming out of her nostrils. An older child, however, told police the grandmother had beaten the girl with a pipe. An autopsy found injuries from her head to her calves, along with scars from earlier injuries. The Division of Family and Children Services had been contacted two weeks earlier when the child was treated at a hospital, but it wasn’t clear whether the agency investigated. The grandmother was charged with murder.</p>
							<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> DeKalb County’s child fatality review committee looked at the case for the first time on Oct. 22, 2013 – 14 months after the girl died. The committee did not assess the performance of DFCS or other Georgia agencies; it did, however, complain that Florida officials, who had placed the children with the grandmother, should have conducted “more consistent follow-up.”</p>

							<p><strong>County:</strong> Wayne<br>
							<strong>Child’s age:</strong> 1 month<br>
							<strong>Date of death:</strong> April 5, 2012<br>
							<strong>Cause of death:</strong> “Sudden unexplained death in infancy.”</p>
							<p><strong>Details:</strong> The baby was found in her crib in her mother’s apartment, not breathing, and was later pronounced dead in a hospital. An autopsy could not determine whether she died from natural causes or by another manner.</p>
							<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> : The Wayne County child fatality review committee answered 60 questions on a standardized reporting form as “unknown.” The committee wrote: “This death merits further investigation. Asphyxial deaths, especially those in infants and in weak victims, can be subtle and leave minimal anatomic residua. Correlation with the case circumstances is essential.” The committee’s documents do not indicate whether the death received additional investigation or whether charges were filed.</p>

							<h4>FAMILY HISTORY</h4>
							<p>The child had been a victim of neglect, and the family had been under the supervision of the state Division of Family and Children’s Services.</p>
							<p>Child-welfare officials had removed the girl’s two older siblings from the family home because of neglect. According to court records, the mother had been convicted in a methamphetamine case in Alabama.</p>
							<br>
							<h4>DETAILS OF DEATH</h4>
							<p>The girl’s mother found her body in bed at their home outside Tallapoosa. An autopsy found that she was malnourished and had died from an intentional overdose of Fentanyl, an opiate painkiller mostly used to treat cancer patients. The mother, Melanie Prichard, and the father, Robert Derek Downey, both have been charged with murder. In court records, each has blamed the other for the death.</p>
							<br>
							<h4>PANEL REVIEW</h4>
							<p>The Haralson County child fatality review committee took up the case June 13, 2013 – eight months after the girl’s death. The committee’s report does not indicate that members raised questions about DFCS’ performance in the case.</p>
							<p>The committee made no recommendations. Its only finding was that the review took place too long after the death and that “inadequate investigation precluded having enough information for review.”</p>
